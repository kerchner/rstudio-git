RStudio doesn't (yet) have the facilities for dealing with branches, so anything relating to branches must be done in the Terminal tab (and/or outside RStudio with other tools).

## Pulling a branch from Github



## Making a new branch

Create a new branch, and check it out (all in one step) with:

`git checkout -b my-new-branch`

Any changes you make in RStudio will be made on this branch.

`git push origin my-new-branch`

FIXME: What happens if you simply push from RStudio?

## Pushing 

When you're ready to push your changes...

## Merging


```{r, include=FALSE}
source("../bin/chunk-options.R")
# knitr_fig_path("01-")
```
